## Files Kept (Verified as Used)

### Active Components
- Header.jsx (used in multiple pages)
- Navbar.jsx (used in layout)
- Footer.jsx (used in layout) 
- HeroSection.jsx (used in main page)
- CategoryGrid.jsx (used in main page)
- Features.jsx (used in main page)
- Testimonials.jsx (used in main page)
- Newsletter.jsx (used in main page)
- ModelSelector.jsx (used in catalog and clip-test)
- SearchInput.jsx (used in catalog)
- Grid.jsx (used in catalog)
- AdvancedFilter.jsx (used in catalog layout)

### Services and Utilities
- `lib/utils.js` - Used by shadcn/ui components
- All files in `services/` directory
- All files in `hooks/` directory  
- All files in `data/` directory
- All files in `uiLibrary/` directory

## Error Handling Code Kept
All `console.error()` statements were kept as they are important for debugging production issues. Only debug `console.log()` statements were removed.

## Verification
- âœ… Next.js build completed successfully
- âœ… No missing dependencies
- âœ… No broken imports
- âœ… All remaining components properly exported and imported
